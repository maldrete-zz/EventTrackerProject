## REST API Endpoints

| HTTP Verb | URI                  | Functionality               |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| GET       | `/api/flight/{id}`   | Gets flight by id           |
| POST      | `/api/flight`        | Create a new flight         |
| PUT       | `/api/flight/{fid}`  | Updates flight by flight id |
| DELETE    | `flight/{id}`        | Delete flight by id         |


### Technologies Used
Java programming language used to write the code.
Spring boot
JPA was used for object relational mapping reading, and managing data from the Java objects to relational tables in the database.
Uses JDBC to communicate to database
MySQL to create the database


### Lessons Learned
Learned how to implement REST and how it allowed me to work faster since basic CRUD operations come
pre built into the program. I learned how to switch from useing DAO's and DAOIMPL's to now using Repository's
Service's and ServiceIMPL's. I also learned how useful postman is in testing my rest end points.
